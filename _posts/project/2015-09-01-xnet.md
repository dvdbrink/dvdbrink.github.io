Thin wrapper around the [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) protocol, written in Java. Supports multiple levels of sending UDP packets reliable. Influenced by [Lidgren Network Library](https://github.com/lidgren/lidgren-network-gen3).

## Goals
* Provide a simple and extendable API.
* High performance networking suitable for game development.
* Multiple levels of reliability for sending UDP packets.
* Cross-platform implementation.

## Status
* Fluctuating API.
* Working on a proof of concept implementation ([corena](https://danielvandenbrink.com/project/corena)) for more insight on how to improve the API.

## Roadmap
* Stable and extendable API.
