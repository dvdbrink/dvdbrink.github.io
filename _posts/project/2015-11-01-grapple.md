## Goals
* Gain experience with [Unity](http://unity3d.com/).
* Proof of concept implementation for [procedural](https://danielvandenbrink.com/project/procedural).

## Status
Single layer of basic software-based generated terrain with unoptimized unity collisions.

## Roadmap
* GPU-based procedural generation (Compute shader).
* First persion movement.
* Basic implementation of grappling hook.
