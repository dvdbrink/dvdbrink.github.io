## Goals
* Gain experience with [XNA 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA).
* Multiple puzzles explaining various aspects of light.
* Support for 2-player local co-op (puzzles require 2 players).

## Lessons learned
* Test performance on a all platforms from the beginning. Xbox 360 is quite a different beast compared to a gaming desktop.
* Working with an external party (artists) is difficult.
